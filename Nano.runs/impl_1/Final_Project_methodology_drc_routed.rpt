2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Nano_Processor_0/Program_counter_0/D_FF_1/Load_Sel_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Nano_Processor_0/Instruction_Decoder_0/Add_Sub_Sel_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
